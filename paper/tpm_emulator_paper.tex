When developing and researching new technologies such as TPM-based large-scale distributed trusted
computing systems, means to investigate their behavior and evaluate their performance are of
paramount importance. In the networking community, test-beds and software simulators are the methods
of choice in order to conduct network performance analysis and protocol evaluations. We argue that
these methods would also be valuable tools for evaluating and understanding the behavior of
TPM-based distributed trusted computing systems. However, due to the security properties of hardware
TPMs, building such a test-bed is extremely cumbersome and costly, the realistic (hardware-supported)
simulation of these systems virtually infeasible. In this paper, we therefore advocate the usage of
software-based TPMs to solve this hardware dependency and present an efficient and portable TPM
emulator for Unix. Our emulator enables not only the implementation of flexible and low-cost
test-beds and simulators but, in addition, provides programmers of trusted systems with a powerful
testing and debugging tool that can also be used for training and educational purposes. Thanks to
its portability and interoperability, the TPM emulator runs on a variety of platforms and is
compatible with the most relevant software tools and APIs.

\section{Introduction}
In the area of trusted computing, the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) \cite{TCG} has developed
various specifications for trusted computing building blocks and software interfaces, among which
the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) \cite{TCGSpec} is likely to be the most popular one. These
specifications are clearly gaining momentum and the increasing availability of TPMs will soon make
it a quasi standard component in today's personal and mobile computers. A TPM, as specified by the
TCG, provides a hardware root of trust for storage as well as for reporting and, together with
the BIOS as the root of trust for measurement, opens many new possibilities in the field of
distributed trusted computing.

When developing and researching new technologies, means to investigate their behavior and evaluate
their performance are of paramount importance. This is particularly true for complex large-scale
distributed systems comprising thousands of nodes and users.
% where one has not only to cope with node failures or temporary unavailability but also with
% communication issues such as packet losses and unpredictable delays.
In the networking community, test-beds and software simulators are the methods of choice in order
to conduct network performance analysis and protocol evaluations. We argue that these methods would
also be valuable tools for evaluating and understanding the behavior of (large-scale) distributed
trusted computing systems. However, the security properties of hardware TPMs permit only one TPM
per platform and limit the degree to which the effects of an executed command can be undone as well
as to what extent the internal state a of TPM can be (re)stored or preset. Moreover, certain actions
cannot be revoked at all or require the physical presence of an operator. Also, TPMs provide almost
no feedback in the case of internal or usage errors. Due to these limitations, building a test-bed
for the execution and evaluation of TPM-based distributed trusted computing systems is extremely
cumbersome and costly, the realistic (hardware-supported) simulation of these systems virtually
infeasible.

In this paper, we therefore advocate the usage of software-based TPMs to solve this hardware
dependency, and present an efficient and portable open-source TPM emulator for Unix \cite{TPMEmu}.
The possibility to run more than one TPM emulator instance per platform and to restore previously
stored or artificially created states allows for the implementation of flexible and low-cost
test-beds and simulators. Running entirely in software, the TPM emulator can further be used to
enhance virtual machines, thus enabling the execution of TPM-based software in a trustworthy
virtualisation environment (see, e.g., \cite{Xen}). The TPM emulator also facilitates the
evaluation of TPM extensions and enhancements. Researchers from Princeton University, NEC Labs, and
Texas Instruments R\&D, for instance, used our emulator to evaluate the impact on the TPM's energy
and execution time overhead if the RSA algorithm is replaced with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
\cite{Aaraj}. Finally, the emulator provides programmers of trusted systems with a powerful testing
and debugging tool that can also be used for training and educational purposes. Thanks to its
portability and interoperability, the TPM emulator runs on a variety of different computing
platforms (e.g., Intel, AMD, StrongARM, and PowerPC) and is compatible with the most relevant
software tools and APIs such as TrouSerS \cite{trousers} and IBM's TPM utilities \cite{IBMtools}.


\section{Background: Trusted Computing and Trusted Platform Module}\label{sec:background}
In this section, we summarize the TCG's definitions regarding trusted computing and provide a brief
overview of the structure and functionality of the TPM. For a comprehensive description, the reader
is referred to the TCG architecture overview and specifications \cite{TCGArch, TCGSpec}.

Trusted computing is about embedding a trusted computing base (TCB)~\cite{Bishop2003} in a computing
platform that allows a third party to determine the trustworthiness of the platform, that is,
whether or not the platform is a \emph{trusted platform}.
% Therefore, a relationship of trust must
% be established between the third party and the computing platform so that the third party believes
% that an expected boot process, a selected operating system, and a set of selected security
% functions in the computing platform have been properly installed and operate correctly.
The Trusted
Computing Group (TCG) has specified a TCB for trusted computing in the form of three so-called roots
of trust~\cite{TCGArch}: the \emph{Root of Trust for Storage} (RTS), the \emph{Root of Trust for
Reporting} (RTR), and the \emph{Root of Trust for Measurement} (RTM). The \emph{Trusted Platform
Module} (TPM) as specified by the TCG is a hardware component that acts as a root of trust for
storage and reporting. More precisely, it provides four major classes of functions: (1) secure
storage and reporting of platform configurations, (2) protected key and data storage, (3)
cryptographic functions, and (4) initialization and management functions. TPMs which comply with
the TPM specification 1.2 additionally include monotonic counters, timing-ticks, non-volatile
storage, auditing functions, and authorization delegation.

\subsection{Root of Trust for Measurement}
When a computer is booted, control passes between different subsystems. First the BIOS is given
control of the computer, followed by the boot loader, the operating system loader, and finally the
operating system. In an \emph{authenticated boot}, there is a bootstrapping process in which,
starting with the BIOS, one subsystem measures the next in the boot sequence and records the
obtained value before executing its successor. More precisely, the BIOS measures (i.e.,
cryptographically hashes) the boot loader prior to handing over control. The boot loader, in turn,
measures the operating system loader, and the operating system loader measures the operating system.
These measurements reflect what software stack is in control of the computer at the end of the boot
sequence; in other words, they reflect the platform configuration. Hence the name \emph{Platform
Configuration Register} (PCR) for the TPM registers where such measurements are stored and which
are initialized at startup and extended at every step of the boot sequence. In order to allow the
storage of an unlimited number of measurements in a specific PCR register, its new value is
dependent on both its old value and the new value to be added. Consequently, updates to PCRs are
not commutative and cannot be be undone until the platform is rebooted. The philosophy behind this
process of integrity measurement and storage is that a platform may be permitted to enter any
state, including undesirable or insecure states, but that it cannot lie about states that it was
or was not in.

\subsection{Root of Trust for Reporting}
Each TPM has an \emph{endorsement key} (EK) which is a signing key whose public key is certified by
a trusted third party, such as the TPM manufacturer. For privacy reasons, the EK is only used to
obtain a key certificate from a certificate authority (CA) for an \emph{attestation identity key}
(AIK), which the TPM generates itself. In order to avoid a possible linkage of the several AIK by
the CA, direct anonymous attestation (DAA)~\cite{BrickellEtAl2004,Camenisch2004} can be used
for certifying AIKs. Moreover, the CA-based solution is faced with the disadvantage that the CA
needs to be involved in every transaction and thus becomes a communication bottleneck. AIKs are
signing keys whose private key is only used for signing data that has originated in the TPM. For
example, a remote party interested in learning what software stack is in control of the computer
can query the TPM for PCR values. The query contains the set of PCRs to look up and a nonce (in
order for the remote party to check for replay attacks). The TPM answers with the respective PCR
values and the signature generated by signing the values as well as the nonce with one of its AIKs.
Put differently, the TPM \emph{attests} to, or \emph{reports} on, the platform configuration.

\subsection{Root of Trust for Storage}
The protected storage feature of a TPM allows for the secure storage of sensitive objects such
as TPM keys and confidential data. However, storage and cost constraints require that only the
necessary (i.e., currently used) objects can reside inside a TPM; the remaining objects must
be stored outside in unprotected memory and are revealed to the user or loaded into the TPM on
demand. To this end, externally stored objects are encrypted (or \emph{wrapped} in TCG terminology)
with an asymmetric \emph{storage key}, which is referred to as the parent key of the object. A
parent key can again be stored outside the TPM and (possibly along with other keys) be protected by
another storage key. The thereby induced storage tree is rooted at the so called \emph{storage root
key} (SRK), which is created upon initialization of the TPM and cannot be unloaded. Consequently,
a parent key has to be loaded into the TPM before the data it protects can be revealed or a key
decrypted (or \emph{unwrapped} in TCG terminology) and loaded into the TPM. Note that protected keys
are only used inside the TPM and thus (in contrast to arbitrary data) are never disclosed to the
user. Furthermore, each key is either marked as being \emph{migrateable} or \emph{non-migrateable}.
In the former case, the key might be replicated and moved to other platforms whereas in the latter
case the key is bound to an individual TPM and is never duplicated. Note further that owing to the
limited data size that can be directly protected by the TPM, not the objects themselves but a
symmetric key which is used to (de-)encrypt the objects is typically protected. Regarding the
actual protection of objects, the TPM specification differentiates between between \emph{binding}
and \emph{sealing}:
Binding is the operation of encrypting an object with the public key of a \emph{binding key}. If
the binding key is non-migratable, only the TPM that created the key can use its private key;
hence, the encrypted object is effectively bound to a particular TPM. Sealing takes binding one
step further: the object is not only bound to a particular TPM, but in addition can only be
decrypted if the current platform configuration matches the values associated with the protected
object at the time of encryption.

\subsection{Cryptographic Functions}
In order to be functional and to meet the TCG specifications, a TPM must support a minimum set of
cryptographic algorithms and operations. However, a TPM is not supposed to be a cryptographic
accelerator; there are no specified minimum throughput requirements for any of the cryptographic
functions. The mandatory cryptographic functions are: a) An either true hardware-based or
algorithmic pseudo random-number generator as the source of randomness for the generation of nonces,
keys, and the randomness in signatures; b) a SHA-1 message digest function and a SHA-1-based
message authentication code (HMAC) engine; and c) a RSA signing, encryption and key-generation
unit for key lengths of up to 2048-bits.

\subsection{Startup}
A TPM can be started in three different modes: \emph{clear}, \emph{state}, and \emph{deactivated}.
In mode clear, the platform starts in a cleared state where (almost) all data is reset to
its default value. In mode state, which is the default mode, a previously saved state is
restored and the TPM continues operation from the restored state. In mode deactivated, the TPM
deactivates itself and disallows any further operations.

% \subsubsection{TPM Ownership}
% Taking ownership of a TPM is the process of inserting a shared secret into a TPM's shielded-location.
% Proving knowledge of this authentication value proves that the calling entity is the TPM owner. The
% owner of the TPM has ultimate administrative control, in particular it can enable or disable the
% TPM, create AIKs and set policies for the TPM. There is no mechanism to recover a lost TPM owner
% authentication value. Recovery from a lost or forgotten authentication value involves removing the
% old value and installing a new one, thereby invalidating all information associated with the
% previous value.
% The semantics of platform ownership are tied to the root of trust for storage (RTS).
% During the process of taking ownership, a new Storage Root Key (SRK) and a new (unique)
% TPM proof-value are created. It follows that objects owned by a previous owner will
% not be inherited by the new owner and must (if still needed) be explicitly transferred.

\subsubsection{Command Authorization}
The purpose of the authorization protocols and mechanisms is to prove to the TPM that the
initiator of a command has permission to execute it and to access the involved data objects.
For instance, they are used to establish platform ownership, restrict key usage, and to
apply access control to (protected) objects. The proof comes from the knowledge of a shared
secret, the so called authorization data. The TPM treats knowledge of the authorization data
as complete proof, no other checks are necessary.

% There are three protocols to proof the knowledge of a specific piece of authorization data. The
% \textit{Object-Independent Authorization Protocol} (OIAP) supports multiple authorization
% sessions for arbitrary entities whereby each entity has to be authorized individually.
% The \textit{Object-Specific Authorization Protocol} (OSAP) supports an authorization session
% for a single entity only, but has the advantage that the authorization data has to be used only
% once during the whole session. The \textit{ Delegate-Specific Authorization Protocol} (DSAP)
% supports the delegation of owner or entity authorization. New authorization information is inserted
% by the \textit{Authorization Data Insertion Protocol} (ADIP) during the creation of an entity. The
% \textit{Authorization Data Change Protocol} (ADCP) and the \textit{Asymmetric Authorization Change
% Protocol} (AACP) allow the changing of the authorization data for an entity.
%
% The protocols use a rolling nonce paradigm that is, they require that a nonce from one side is
% in use only for one message and its reply. For instance, a TPM's nonce which is returned as part
% of its command reply is part of the next command request. This mechanism is used to prevent
% reply as well as man-in-the-middle attacks.

\subsection{Auxiliary Functions}
TPMs which conform to the TPM specification 1.2 additionally include the following auxiliary
functions: \emph{Monotonic counters} implement an ever-increasing incremental value which is
designed to not wear out in the first 7 years of operation (with an increment once every 5 seconds).
\emph{Non volatile storage} provides the manufacturers and owners of a TPM with a protected and
shielded non-volatile storage area for storing sensitive or confidential information.
\emph{Auditing} gives the TPM owner the ability to determine that certain operations on the TPM
have been executed. \emph{Authorization delegation} allows for the delegation of individual TPM
owner privileges (i.e., the right to use individual owner authorized TPM commands) to individual
entities.

% \paragraph{Monotonic Counters}
% Monotonic counters provide an ever-increasing incremental value which is designed to not wear
% out in the first 7 years of operation (with an increment once every 5 seconds).
% A TPM must support a minimum of at least 4 concurrent counters.
%
% \paragraph{Non Volatile Storage}
% The TPM contains a protected and shielded non-volatile storage area whose main purpose is to
% provide the manufacturers and owners with a area for storing protected information. It is in
% the responsibility of the TPM owner to set the access and use policy for newly created areas.
% % He can set authorization values, delegations, PCR values and other controls (e.g., whether
% % and how often data might be written to this area). The TPM does not control, edit, validate
% % or manipulate in any manner the information in the non-volatile store. It is merely a storage
% % device that enforces the specified access rules.
%
% \paragraph{Auditing}
% To give the TPM owner the ability to determine that certain operations on the TPM have been
% executed, auditing of commands is possible. The audit value consists of a digest held internally
% by the TPM and an externally stored log of all audited commands. The internal digest is only used
% for detecting manipulations of the external log and does not contain any actual log information.
% % It is in the responsibility of the TPM owner to specify which commands generate an audit event and
% % to change the selection at any time.
%
% \paragraph{Delegation Model}
% The TPM owner is an entity with a single super user privilege to control the TPM.
% Thus, if a TPM requires some kind of management, the TPM owner must perform that task himself
% or reveal his privilege information to another entity. This other entity thereby obtains
% the privilege to operate all TPM controls, not just those intended by the owner. The delegation
% model addresses this issue by allowing delegation of individual TPM owner privileges (i.e., the
% right to use individual owner authorized TPM commands) to individual entities.

\subsection{TPM Command Structure}
TPM commands (responses) are byte arrays which consist of three main parts: a request (response)
header, some command-specific input (output) parameters, and an optional authorization trailer
(see Figure~\ref{fig:tpm_command}). Presence or absence of the authorization trailer depends on the
used command (response) tag field . Integer values which are larger than one byte are encoded
in network byte-order and might have to be converted into the local byte-order of the host platform
as part of the unmarshaling process. Since version 1.2 of the TPM specification, commands can
also be sent from and to the TPM in an encrypted form using the transport encryption command.

\end{figure}

\section{System Design and Implementation}
The TPM emulator package comprises three main parts (see Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview}):
a user-space daemon (tpmd) that implements the actual TPM emulator, a TPM Software Stack (TSS)
conform TPM device driver library (tddl) as the regular interface to access the emulator, and a
kernel module (tpmd\_dev) that provides the device \file{/dev/tpm} for low-level compatibility
with TPM device drivers.

\end{figure}

% \begin{figure}[ht]
% \centering
% \vspace*{50mm}
% \caption{TPM command execution.}
% \label{fig:command_execution}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{TPM Device Driver Library and Kernel Module}
The most correct and convenient way to access a TPM is by means of the so-called TPM Device Driver
Library (TDDL) as specified by the TCG. The library provides a simple and standardized interface for
connecting to a TPM, querying its status and capabilities as well as for sending TPM commands and
receiving the corresponding responses (for a comprehensive description of its functionality we
refer to the official TCG specification \cite{TSS}). Applications that use the TDDL interface can
be forced to use the TPM emulator instead of a real TPM by simply exchanging this library. However,
despite the existence of this well defined and easy to use interface, several applications, tools,
and libraries do not use it but instead directly access the TPM by its device driver interface,
represented by the device file \file{/dev/tpm}. Therefore, and in order to be compatible with
hardware TPMs on the lowest possible level, the TPM emulator package includes a kernel module called
tpmd\_dev. This module emulates a hardware TPM driver by providing the device \file{/dev/tpm} and
by forwarding all TPM commands written into it to the TPM emulator daemon. This process is
completely transparent for an application and indistinguishable from the interaction with a real TPM.

\subsection{TPM Emulator Daemon}
The TPM emulator daemon implements the actual TPM emulator and consists of the daemon application,
the TPM emulator engine, and the crypto module. After initializing the TPM emulator engine, the
daemon application opens a Unix domain socket and listens on it for incoming TPM commands. Upon
the reception of a valid command, the command is processed by the TPM emulator engine and the
corresponding response returned to the sender of the  command. Per default the socket name
\file{/var/tpm/tpmd\_socket:0} is used but, if required (e.g., if more than one TPM emulator
instance has to be started), an alternative name can be specified as a command-line argument.

\subsubsection{TPM Emulator Engine}
% From a functional point of view, the TPM emulator engine is further divided into the parameter
% (un)marshaling and (de)coding entity, the command execution engine, the cryptographic engine and
% the key, data, and state storage entity. Each part interacts with the others over a small set of
% well-defined functions.

The public API of the TPM emulator engine consists of only three functions. The first function
to be called is \func{tpm\_emulator\_init()} which initializes the emulator. The function
\func{tpm\_\-handle\_\-command()} can then be used to execute an arbitrary number of TPM commands,
before a call of \func{tpm\_emulator\_shutdown()} shuts down the emulator.

\paragraph{Initialization and Self-Test}
The initialization of the TPM emulator proceeds in three steps:
First, all data elements are set to their default values. % The only exceptions are the \emph{disable}
% and \emph{deactivated} flags which are set to false although their default value is specified as
% true. This is done because starting the emulator can be seen as the users indication to use (i.e.,
% enable and activate) the TPM.
Next, an internal self-test of all cryptographic functions
is preformed. If one of the tests fails, the emulator goes into a fail-stop mode and returns
a corresponding error message on each command call. Finally, if all tests succeeded, the emulator
starts in the specified startup mode and the remaining internal data is initialized accordingly.
In the particular case of startup mode \emph{save} this includes the restoration of all persistent
data from the persistent data storage file (\file{/var/tpm/tpm\_emulator-1.2.x.y} per default).
Should the restoration of a previously stored state fail, the emulator also goes into a fail-stop
mode.

\paragraph{Shutdown and Data Storage}
On a regular shutdown, that is, if the emulator is not in fail-stop mode, all persistent data is
written into the persistent data storage file. Otherwise, the internal state of the TPM emulator
is discarded in order to avoid that temporary malfunctions lead to a permanent failure of the
emulator. Finally, all allocated resources such as memory and handles are released.

\paragraph{Command Execution}
The execution of a TPM command is initiated by calling the function \func{tpm\_\-handle\_\-command()}
with the marshaled TPM command (i.e., a byte array) as input parameter. The command is then
processed in three steps: In the first step, the command
is first decoded into its three main components: the request header, the command parameters, and
the (optional) authorization trailer (see Figure~\ref{fig:tpm_command}). After verifying whether the
command is allowed to be executed in the current state of the TPM, the input parameter digest is
computed and the parameters are further unmarshaled according to the specific TPM command. The
second step performs the actual execution of the command and sets the command response parameters.
If required, the authorization trailer is verified in order to guarantee command authorization and
integrity of the input parameters. In the last step, the response authorization is computed and
combined with the response parameters and the response header. Finally, the response is
marshaled into its byte representation and returned to the caller.

\paragraph{Portability and System Independence}
In order to facilitate the porting of the TPM emulator, the TPM emulator engine contains no
operating system or platform dependent functions (e.g., memory allocation and file handling),
but accesses them by a set of predefined functions. The actual implementation of these functions
is in the responsibility of the OS-dependent application. The therefore required API as well as
all system specific settings (e.g., whether the system uses little- or big-endian byte ordering
etc.) are specified in the header file \file{tpm\_emulator\_config.h}.

Similar considerations lead to the separation and encapsulation of all cryptographic functions.
The TPM emulator accesses the required functionality, namely the SHA-1, HMAC, random, RSA, RC4,
and multiple precision integer arithmetic (bignum) methods by means of well defined interfaces,
but does not make any further assumptions regarding their implementation. This allows for an easy
replacement of individual function blocks, for instance in the case of (partly) available hardware
support.


\section{Evaluation}
In order to investigate the scalability of our TPM emulator in relation to the number of
concurrently executed emulator instances on the same platform, a number of TPM emulator daemons was
started and a series of TPM command executions was initiated on each instance in parallel. All
experiments were conducted on a IBM ThinkPad T43p (Pentium M @ 2\,GHz and 1\,GByte RAM) using Linux
kernel 2.6.19. The measured duration between sending the commands and receiving all corresponding
responses is shown in Figure~\ref{plot:execution_time}. One can see that for light-weight
(Figure~\ref{plot:execution_time}(a)) as well as for computation-intensive commands
(Figure~\ref{plot:execution_time}(b)) the required time increases linearly with the number of
concurrently running emulator instances. This shows that except for the unavoidable slowdown due
to the availability of only one single CPU, no significant overhead is introduced by concurrently
executing more than one emulator instance.

The results of several TPM compliance and functionality tests, in particular those provided by
\cite{trousers,ibmdaatest} and \cite{Sadeghi}, are summarized in Figure~\ref{plot:compliance}.

We observe that, even though the emulator still lacks some functionality, the most important and
frequently used commands are already supported and are compliant with the TPM specification 1.2.
% As a result, our TPM emulator is compatible with the most relevant software APIs and works
% perfectly well with almost all available TPM-enabled Unix applications.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this paper, we presented a software-based TPM emulator for Unix. Even though the emulator still
lacks some functionality, it is compatible with the most relevant software APIs and works perfectly
well with almost all available TPM-enabled Unix applications, as the most important and frequently
used commands are already supported. We showed that hundreds of (concurrently running) TPM's can
be efficiently simulated on a single platform, allowing for the implementation of low-cost test-beds
and simulators. In addition, the emulator provides programmers of trusted systems with a powerful
testing and debugging tool that can also be used for training and educational purposes. Our TPM
emulator is still a work in progress and future work will include the completion of the missing
commands as well as the portage of the TPM emulator package to Windows and Mac OS X.
